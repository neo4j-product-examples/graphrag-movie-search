### __:warning: This Repo is Work in Progress :warning:__

This project is designed to implement an agent capable of interacting with a graph database like Neo4j through a semantic layer using OpenAI function calling.
The semantic layer equips the agent with a suite of robust tools, allowing it to interact with the graph database based on the user's intent. Read more in the [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/enhancing-interaction-between-language-models-and-graph-databases-via-a-semantic-layer-0a78ad3eba49).

![Workflow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasonjo/llm-movieagent/main/api/packages/neo4j-semantic-layer/static/workflow.png)

To start the project, run the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser to interact with the agent.

## Tools

The agent utilizes several tools to interact with the Neo4j graph database effectively:

1. **Information tool**:
   - Retrieves data about movies or individuals, ensuring the agent has access to the latest and most relevant information.
2. **Recommendation Tool**:
   - Provides movie recommendations based upon user preferences and input.
3. **Plot Tool**:
   - Finds movies based by their description using vector similarity search.
4. **Aggregation Tool**:
   - Calculates statistics by generating Cypher statements.
   

## Environment Setup

You need to define the following environment variables in the `.env` file.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
NEO4J_URI=<YOUR_NEO4J_URI>
NEO4J_USERNAME=<YOUR_NEO4J_USERNAME>
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<YOUR_NEO4J_PASSWORD>
```

## Docker containers

This project contains the following services wrapped as docker containers

1. **Neo4j**:
   - Neo4j, a graph database, is used to store the information about actors, movies, and their ratings.
2. **API**:
   - Uses LangChain's `neo4j-semantic-layer` template to implement the OpenAI LLM and function calling capabilities.
3. **UI**:
   - Simple streamlit chat user interface. Available on `localhost:8501`.

## Populating with data 
TBD
